# Overview

Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization that involves encapsulating an application in a container with its own operating environment. 

Containers are isolated from one another and from the host system, but they share the same kernel. 
This makes them faster and more efficient than virtual machines. 
Containers are portable and can run on any system that supports the container runtime. 
They are used to package, distribute, and run applications consistently across different environments. 
Containers are widely used in software development and operations to improve productivity, scalability, and reliability. 
They are also used in cloud computing, microservices, and DevOps. 

Containers enable developers to package their applications with
all the necessary libraries, frameworks, and dependencies, eliminating the infamous "*It works on my machine*" problem and
ensuring consistent behavior across different systems.

This guide provides an overview of containers and their use cases. 
It covers container management, orchestration, and specialized containers for specific tasks. 
It also includes tutorials, best practices, and resources for learning more about containers.
