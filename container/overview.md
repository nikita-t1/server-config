# Overview

Docker provides a lightweight and portable environment that encapsulates an application and its dependencies, allowing
it to run consistently across different environments. 

Containers enable developers to package their applications with
all the necessary libraries, frameworks, and dependencies, eliminating the infamous "*It works on my machine*" problem and
ensuring consistent behavior across different systems.

This Guide will cover a wide range of containers, each serving a unique purpose and catering to various aspects of
software development and operations. From container management and orchestration to specialized containers for specific
tasks.
