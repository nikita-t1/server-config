## [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)

## [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)

> exa is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux
> operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
> It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.

``` bash
sudo apt install exa
```

Set ```exa -la``` as an alias for ```ls```

``` bash
echo "alias ls='exa -la'" >> .bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
```

::: tip
You can even add icons with the `--icons` flag, if you have a font that supports icons, like [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/).
:::

## [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

> A cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.

``` bash
sudo apt install bat
```

On Ubuntu the command is ```batcat``` imstead of ```bat```
Lets change that:

``` bash
echo "alias bat='batcat'" >> .bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
```

## [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)

> **micro** is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of
> the capabilities of modern terminals. It comes as a single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies; you
> can download and use it right now!

``` bash
sudo apt install micro
```

::: tip
unlike nano, micro uses keyboard shortcuts that you are probably familiar with from almost all graphical user interfaces
``` json
"Ctrl-s":  "Save",
"Ctrl-f":  "Find",
"Ctrl-n":  "FindNext",
"Ctrl-p":  "FindPrevious",
"Ctrl-z":  "Undo",
"Ctrl-y":  "Redo",
"Ctrl-c":  "CopyLine|Copy",
"Ctrl-x":  "Cut",
"Ctrl-k":  "CutLine",
"Ctrl-d":  "DuplicateLine",
"Ctrl-v":  "Paste",
"Ctrl-a":  "SelectAll",
"Ctrl-q":  "Quit",
```

## [htop](https://htop.dev/)

> htop is a cross-platform interactive process viewer. htop allows scrolling the list of processes vertically and
> horizontally to see their full command lines and related information like memory and CPU consumption. Also system wide
> information, like load average or swap usage, is shown.

``` bash
sudo apt-get install htop 
```
